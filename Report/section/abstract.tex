This report describes the use of the \verb|ns/2| network event simulator to simulate the behaviour of simple network topologies.
Two topology situations are considered. For the first situation, the focus lies on an \ac{FTP} application competing for bandwidth with a \ac{CBR} application. 
In the second situation, we investigate the evolution of the congestion window size during the execution of the \ac{TCP} algorithm in detail; an \ac{FTP} application is running continuously while a web user on the same LAN as the \ac{FTP} application generates short intense bursts of traffic. We also compare congestion window size behaviour between
the Tahoe implementation of \ac{TCP} and the Reno implementation of \ac{TCP}.
