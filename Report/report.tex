\title{Network Simulation with ns/2: report}
\author{Maarten Tegelaers \and Thomas Vochten}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report describes the use of the ns/2 network event simulator to simulate the behaviour of simple network topologies.
Two topology situations are considered. For the first situation, the focus lies on an FTP application competing for bandwidth
with a CBR application. In the second situation, we investigate the evolution of the congestion window size during the
execution of the TCP algorithm in detail; an FTP application is running continuously while a web user on the same LAN as
the FTP application generates short intense bursts of traffic. We also compare congestion window size behaviour between
the Tahoe implementation of TCP and the Reno implementation of TCP.
